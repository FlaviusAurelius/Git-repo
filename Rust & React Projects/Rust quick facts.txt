- cargo new hello_cargo 
    Creates a new project and new directory called hello_cargo. Cargo will have generated the following:
|   cargo.toml      
|       In TOML format, cargo's config format. Stores information and packages
|   main.rs
|       

- cargo build
    Creates an executable in target/debug/project_name rather than in current directory because default build is a DEBUG BUILD
        -- also creates a new file at the top level called cargo.lock and it keeps track of the exact versions of dependencies in your project.
- cargo run
    compiles the code and run the resulting exe in one command, saves time during test by not having to type cargo build repeatedly

- cargo check
    checks code and make sure it compiles. Doesn't produce an exe

- cargo build --release
    compiles the code with optimizations. This creates an exe in target/release directory and makes the code run faster, but increases the compilation time
