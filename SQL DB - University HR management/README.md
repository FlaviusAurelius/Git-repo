# SQL - University/College management system	
As the title suggests, this project is intended to be a jumping point for a more elaborate university/college management system.

As such, it contains various useful information such as student ID and other relevant information that would be necessary in a university management system.

All tables in this DB was normalized, and a picture of the DB design was provided alongside scripts that was used to create all the assest.

This project was tested on Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18
